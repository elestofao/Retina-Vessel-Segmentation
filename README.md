# Retina-Vessel-Segmentation
In this project, a segmentation method was developed to extract retinal blood vessels from fundus images using the DRIVE dataset (Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction). The developed method focuses on improving segmentation accuracy without using Deep Learning techniques. The methodology proposed is based on mathematical morphology.
